~;~;#dr.jones_intro;Well then what the hell are you doing here? Nobody ever comes up to this place.;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_intro;Never mind that, I need that package to confirm my hypothesis. Time is of the essence.;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_intro;Knowing those unreliable drivers, they probably sent it to the wrong address. ;~;~

~;~;#dr.jones_after;The star already exploded . . . we're doomed . . .;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_after;We have less than 1 minute . . .;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_after;Since this is the end, I'm at least grateful to spend these last moments doing what I love. ;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_after;Even though you're young, I hope you lived a fulfulling life. ;~;~
~;~;#dr.jones_after;The world we know is about to vanish. Not even our memories will remain.;~;~
