~;~;#andy;She'll be mad if you don't do what you're told . . .;~;~
~;~;#andy;You really are determined to leave, huh?;~;~
~;~;#andy;As long as you're back before the sermon starts, I guess I don't care.;~;~
~;~;#andy;You should take your watch with you when you go. Just be back before the sermon.;~;~
~;~;#andy;She said it'll be at 9:30. It will be your fault if we get punished again!;~;~
