~;~;#andy;She'll be mad if you don't do what you're told . . .;~;~
~;~;#andy;You really are determined to leave, huh?;~;~
~;~;#andy;As long as you're back before the sermon starts, I guess you'll be fine.;~;~
~;~;#andy_repeat;You should take your watch with you when you go. Just be back before the sermon.;#watch;~
