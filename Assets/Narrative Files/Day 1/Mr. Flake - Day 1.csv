~;#boot;#already_boot;That boot you have. . . Looks familiar, can I have a look?;~;#detective #mrflake #mrflake_boot #mrflakecheck #boot #beach_key

~;~;#already_boot;Where did you find this? This boot belongs to a man named Eli, we've been looking for him for some time.;~;~
~;~;#already_boot;We had. . . An incident with him. ;~;~
~;~;#already_boot;You say you found it in the middle of the woods? Excellent, well done kid.;~;~
~;~;#already_boot;Whether it was purposeful or not, you helped me. I should give you something in return.;~;~
~;~;#already_boot;I own the south beach, it's private and relatively quiet. Go there, enjoy your final hours if you believe in that nonsense.;~;~
~;~;#already_boot;If you find any more clues about Eli, bring them to me immediately.;~;~

~;~;#mrflake;Oh you came across my associates? ;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;Well I guess I don't have to introduce myself. If there's anything you need, my store has it. ;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;This end of the world shit is making me a fortune! People will believe anything they see on the news.;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;Sadly we've lost an employee recently, so we're a bit shortstaffed. They'll be back soon.;~;~

~;~;#mrflake;Barry and Jerry told you that he uh, stole something from us, yes?;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;This. . . incident, happened some time ago and we are still looking for him.;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;Help me find a clue to his whereabouts and there will be a reward in it for you, my friend.;~;~
~;~;#mrflake;But if you learn where he is and don't tell me, you'll suffer the same fate as him.;~;~

~;~;#mrflake_boot;Aha! Yes!! This boot is part of my employees' uniform.;~;~
~;~;#mrflake_boot;You say it was in the middle of the woods? Excellent, well done kid.;~;~
~;~;#mrflake_boot;It seems like you can be trusted, so about that reward . . .;~;~
~;~;#mrflake_boot;I own the south beach, it's private and relatively quiet. Go there, enjoy your final hours if you believe in that nonsense.;~;~
