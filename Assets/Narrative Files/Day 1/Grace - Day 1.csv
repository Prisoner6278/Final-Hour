~;~;#grace_intro;I'm wishing for the world not to end.;~;~
~;~;#grace_intro;If I only had a few more coins just to be sure!;~;~
~;~;#grace_intro;There has to be some around the town! I want to do it myself, but I'm not old enough.;~;~
~;~;#grace_intro;Mommy and Daddy won't let me leave the house.;~;~
~;~;#grace_intro;If you bring me coins, I'll give you a present!;~;~
